                    The clinical protocol incorporates semistructured
                    interviews, of the patient and informant to obtain
                    information sufficient to rate the subjectâ€™s cognitive
                    performance in 6 domains: memory, orientation, judgment and
                    problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and
                    personal care. each domain is rated on 5 levels of
                    impairment: 0 (none), 0.5 (questionable), 1 (mild), 2
                    (moderate), and 3 (severe). An exception is that personal
                    care is rated on only a 4-point scale: 0 to 3.

                    The global CDR represents a 5-point ordinal scale, where CDR
                    0 indicates no dementia, and CDR 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 indicate
                    questionable, mild, moderate, and severe dementia. Thus
