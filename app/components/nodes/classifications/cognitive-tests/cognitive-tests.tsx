                Culture may affect the validity of the cognitive tests used to
                identify MCI through biases related to the test or
                administration. For instance, where the construct an item is
                measuring is ambiguous due to poor translation or lack of
                cultural equivalent, or where there is unfamiliarity with both
                testing and stimuli or the related skill does not exist within a
                cultural repertoire.

                At least in MoCA the use of universal cut-offs also leads to a
                sampling bias (i.e. sample for which the cut off was established
                does not match with the individual being assessed) which, if
                uncontrolled, leads to false conclusions about an individualâ€™s
                cognitive ability.
