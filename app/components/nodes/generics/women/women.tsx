                Nonetheless, it is now accepted that the perimenopause to
                menopause transition disrupts multiple estrogen-regulated
                systems, thereby affecting multiple domains of cognitive
                function (Brinton et al., 2015; Christensen and Pike, 2015).
                Indeed, recent preclinical studies have implicated that a shift
                in the bioenergetics system of the brain during menopause onset
                could serve as an early initiating mechanism for increased AD
                risk in the female brain (Brinton et al., 2015; Mosconi et al.,
                2017a,b). These biological variables may lead to increased fatty
                acid catabolism, AÎ² deposition, and impaired synaptic plasticity
                (Liu et al., 2008; Brinton, 2009; Yao and Brinton, 2012), which
                could serve as a mechanism that triggers AD (Brinton et al.,
                2015).
