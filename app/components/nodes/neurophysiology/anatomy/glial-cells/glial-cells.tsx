                Microglia (immune cells in the brain) become active when neurons
                are hypoactive. They can further reduce neuronal firing and are
                known to clear synapses and neurons in AD, contributing to loss
                of E. also contribute to synapse removal and become structurally
                abnormal in AD. These changes further disrupt neuron
                communication and could impair brain circuits.

                Microglia can internalize and attempt to degrade tau aggregates
                from dead neurons. However, when overwhelmed, they accumulate
                toxic tau, leading to microglial dysfunction. Microglia can also
                spread tau by packing it into exosomes, which contain highly
                toxic tau forms, facilitating tau pathology spread in the brain.
                Reducing microglia activity suppresses tau spread in animal
                models.

                Oligodendrocytes (cells involved in myelination) are implicated
                in AD, but their specific role is still under research.

            <Hypothesis>
                It is possible to make a model of MEG signal / features based on
                tau and AÎ² that takes into account their interactions with one
                another and with glial cells. As it is possible to predict the
                AD progression based on MEG features it would help understand
                glial cells role in AD progression.
