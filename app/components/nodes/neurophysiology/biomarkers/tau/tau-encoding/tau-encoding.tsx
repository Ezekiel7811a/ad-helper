                Exon 10 encodes for one of the four possible microtubule-binding
                repeat domains (MTBD), which are 31â€“32 aa long imperfect repeat
                sequences, located in the C-terminal half of the tau protein and
                affecting both microtubule-binding affinity and fibrillization
                properties of tau. Splicing isoforms of tau contain either three
                (3R) or four (4R) MTBDs, which affects their microtubule-binding
                affinity (4R &gt; 3R)
