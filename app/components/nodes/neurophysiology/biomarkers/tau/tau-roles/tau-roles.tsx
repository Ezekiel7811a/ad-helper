                The proline-rich domain occupies the central portion of tau from
                residue 151â€“243. It represents the most disordered part of the
                protein and serves as an interaction site for Src homology-3
                (SH3) proteins, in particular the Fyn kinase [26], as well as an
                interaction site for DNA and RNA [27, 28].

                It is also possible that tau localized at the PM occupies a role
                as a signaling regulator, via its interaction with membrane
                receptors [19, 20].

                Synaptic tau has been reported to be involved in synaptic
                development of newborn hippocampal neurons [14].
