                tau can propagate trans-synaptically from one neuron to another,

                (1) Tau secretion directly through the PM involves clustering of
                tau at the PM, interaction with specific lipids in
                cholesterol/sphingomyelin/PI(4,5)P2-rich membrane microdomains,
                penetration through the PM and release from the PM facilitated
                by cell surface HSPGs. This unconventional tau secretion
                mechanism resembles the secretion of FGF2 (UPS I-like). (2) Tau
                is secreted in ectosomes shed from the PM. Ectosomes are larger
                than exosomes and also differ in their molecular composition.
                After their release from cells, both ectosomes and exosomes
                function similarly and can be fused to or endocytosed by target
                cells. (3) Secretion of tau in exosomes and via organelle
                hitchhiking. Tau can be packed in exosomes by inward budding of
                late endosome membrane leading to formation of intraluminal
                vesicles in multivesicular bodies (MVB) that can be secreted by
                fusion of MVB membrane with the PM. Other organelle hitch-hiking
                (UPS III-like) pathways possibly involved in secretion of tau
                and other misfolded cytosolic proteins include secretory
                endo-lysosomes, related to the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. The
                MAPS pathway promotes secretion of cytosolic misfolded proteins
                by chaperone-mediated capture of misfolded cytosolic proteins to
                the ER, followed by secretion via fusion of endo-lysosomal
                vesicles with the PM releasing vesicle-free tau in the
                extracellular space. (4) Cell-to-cell transfer of tau seeds via
                tunneling nanotubes that directly connect the cytosols of two
                neighboring cell. Regardless of the secretion pathway, tau
                aggregates eventually reach the cytosol of the recipient cells,
                allowing templated seeding of healthy tau molecules into
                misfolded pathological conformations. The recipient cells can
                then propagate the pathology further to other previously
                unaffected cells. It is currently unclear which ones of the
                above mechanisms are involved in synaptic release of tau, and
                whether the synaptic release of physiological and pathological
                forms of tau are mediated by the same mechanism(s)

                Different mechanisms are also involved in cellular uptake of
                vesicular tau and vesicle-free tau, and this likely affects the
                efficiency of cellular uptake, subcellular localization of
                internalized tau and the overall seeding potency of different
                forms of tau and in different cell types.

                They propose 4 stages of tau spread: Phase 1: Tau aggregates in
                isolated distal dendrites. Phase 2: Thread-like tau structures
                extending from basal dendrites around a central, mostly
                tau-negative area. Phase 3: Tau pathology in the cell body and
                part of the apical dendrite. Phase 4: Extensive tau pathology
