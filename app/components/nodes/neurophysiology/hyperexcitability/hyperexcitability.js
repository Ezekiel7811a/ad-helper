Next, the block of synaptically released glutamate at active excitatory synapses is an important element of the vicious cycle.

The final element of the cycle is revealed by the dependence of the increase in hyperactivation on the level of baseline activity, both for synthetic and human brainderived Ab dimers.

This view of synchronization as a pathological sign, not as compensatory, would reflect the hyperexcitability of the pyramidal neurons induced by the lack of inhibitory connections caused by the toxic effects of the neuritic plaques as previously shown in animal models (Cirrito et al., 2005; Garcia-Marin et al., 2009).
