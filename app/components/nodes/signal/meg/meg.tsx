        Recently, a range of novel features derived from electroencephalography
        (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings have been described as
        robust proxy makers for noninvasive real-time measurements of changes in
        E/I balance.

      Nakamura et al. (2017): This MEG study found altered network organization
      in healthy elderly individuals with high amyloid levels, particularly in
      the inferior parietal lobe and precuneus. The correlation between AÎ² and
      brain synchrony indicates that network impairment precedes metabolic
      (FDG-PET) or structural (MRI) changes, suggesting that M/EEG could detect
      functional changes before visible atrophy.
