        Older adults had lower (slower) &alpha; center frequencies than younger
        adults. Measured as a pourcentage of the canonical &alpha; frequency
        younger = 84%, older = 71%; Specifically, we find that canonical alpha
        band analyses (for example, analyzing the 8â€“12-Hz range) fail to capture
        all of the oscillatory power within individual participants, and are
        systematically biased between groups22. We conclude that periodic
        activity is not the sole driver of the apparent ~10-Hz power differences
        in aging, and that the magnitude of alpha power differences has been
        systemically confounded by concomitant differences in aperiodic
        activity.

        Is it possible that the &theta; frequency increased in AD patients is in
        fact due to slower &alpha; causing a leakage of power into the &theta;
