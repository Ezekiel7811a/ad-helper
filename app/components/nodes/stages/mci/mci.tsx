                we observed an increment of functional connectivity in those
                patients with MCI that progress to Alzheimerâ€™s disease
                [progressive (p)MCI] compared to those that remained stable
                [stable (s)MCI]. We found two networks, one in the theta band
                and the other one in the beta band, where the functional
                connectivity ratio of the pMCI group was lower than that of the
                sMCI group. These networks involved the frontooccipital cortex
                and fronto-temporal regions including the hippocampus.
