        providing an overall measure of cognitive impairment in clinical,
        research and community settings. sensitivities of 23% to 76% and
        specificities from 40% to 94%. n relationship to conversion from MCI to
        Alzheimerâ€™s disease dementia, the accuracy of baseline MMSE scores
        ranged from sensitivities of 27% to 89% and specificities from 32% to

        a 30-question assessment of cognitive function that evaluates attention
        and orientation, memory, registration, recall, calculation, language and
        ability to draw a complex polygon ( Folstein 1975). Traditionally, a
        23/24 cut-off has been used to select patients with suspected cognitive
        impairment or dementia ( Tombaugh 1992 ). However, several studies have
        shown that sociocultural variables, age and education, among other
        factors, could affect individual scores (Bleecker 1988; Brayne 1990;
        Crum 1993); therefore local standards must be developed for each
        population and setting evaluated (Diniz 2007; Kulisevsky 2009; Shiroky
        2007; Trenkle 2007).
