        Microglia (immune cells in the brain) become active when neurons are
        hypoactive. They can further reduce neuronal firing and are known to
        clear synapses and neurons in AD, contributing to loss of E. also
        contribute to synapse removal and become structurally abnormal in AD.
        These changes further disrupt neuron communication and could impair
        brain circuits.

        Astrocytes also contribute to synapse removal and become structurally

        Oligodendrocytes (cells involved in myelination) are implicated in AD,
        but their specific role is still under research.

      <Hypothesis>
        It is possible to make a model of MEG signal / features based on tau and
        AÎ² that takes into account their interactions with one another and with
        glial cells. As it is possible to predict the AD progression based on
        MEG features it would help understand glial cells role in AD
        progression.
