APP inside the neuron increases the amyloid-b production that is secreted into the brain interstitial fluid. The accumulation of soluble amyloid-b within the interstitial fluid becomes abnormal during Alzheimer\u2019s disease as amyloid-b starts to aggregate into soluble amyloid-b oligomers and extracellular amyloidb plaques (Cirrito et al., 2005).Both amyloid-b forms exert a toxic effect on cells, causing the synaptic dysfunction that is a critical characteristic of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Selkoe, 2002).", _jsx(CitationCard, { citations: [SynergyABTauCorticalAndMC], children: "A\u03B2 plaques deposition can begin up to two decades before symptom onset1-4,9, initially accumulating in cortical areas with high metabolic baseline activity, such as the precuneus, medial orbitofrontal and posterior cingulate cortices10,11, before spreading to the entire neocortex, brainstem and subcortical nuclei" }), _jsx(CitationCard, { citations: [NeuroChemsOrganizationAd], children: "Amyloid Beta (A\u03B2) Plaques: These plaques, which are a hallmark of AD, are found at high levels (SUVR) in prefrontal and parieto-temporal cortices bilaterally. This spatial pattern aligns with regions showing abnormal rhythmic and aperiodic activity, suggesting a possible direct relationship between A\u03B2 deposition and these neurophysiological changes. Brain regions with high densities of cholinergic (\u03B14\u03B22, M1), cannabinoid (CB1), mu-opioid (MOR), noradrenergic (NET), and specific serotonergic receptors (5-HT6, 5-HT1b) were more likely to show A\u03B2 deposition." }), _jsx(Hypothesis, { children: "A\u03B2 plaques concentration is associated with an increased frequency of epileptiform activity in AD patients." }), "Some studies, like those by Dubois et al.

When A\u03B2 plaques are on the surface of neuronal cell bodies, they disrupt GABAergic synapses in the perisomatic region. This loss of GABAergic inhibition is significant because it may cause neurons to become hyperactive due to a lack of inhibitory control around the cell body. A\u03B2 plaques near the dendrites in the neuropil may lead to the loss of dendritic spines, which are small protrusions that typically form excitatory synapses. This loss of dendritic spines means a partial reduction in excitatory input to those neurons, but it doesn\u2019t heavily impact the overall control of their activity since it only affects part of the dendritic structure. In summary, A\u03B2 plaques can reduce inhibitory synapses (causing hyperactivity) near the cell bodies of neurons and reduce excitatory synapses on dendrites in the neuropil. Each change has a different impact on neuronal activity and synaptic circuits, contributing to the disruptions seen in Alzheimer's Disease."] }), _jsx(Hypothesis, { children: "In Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) patients, a higher density of A\u03B2 plaques will correlate with a flatter PSD slope, particularly in frontal and temporal regions, due to decreased perisomatic GABAergic inhibition and increased neuronal hyperactivity in these areas." }), _jsx(Hypothesis, { children: "Regions with high tau pathology in AD patients will show a steeper PSD slope due to tau's impact on excitatory neurons, resulting in reduced high-frequency power and an increased relative contribution of low-frequency activity." }), _jsx(Hypothesis, { children: "In brain regions with both A\u03B2 and tau pathology, the effect on PSD slope will depend on the relative densities of A\u03B2 versus tau: A\u03B2-dominant regions will have a flatter slope, while tau-dominant regions will exhibit a steeper slope." }), _jsx(CitationCard, { citations: [EITranslationalPerspective], children: "Animal models of AD have shown that A\u03B2 plaques induce local morphological alterations in the dendrites that are in contact with A\u03B2 (e.g., (Knafo et al., 2009; Spires et al., 2005; Tsai et al., 2004))." })] })));
