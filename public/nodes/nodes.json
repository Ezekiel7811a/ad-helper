              "“A” refers to the value of a b-amyloid biomarker (amyloid PET or CSF Ab42); “T,” the value of a tau biomarker (CSF phospho tau, or tau PET); and “N,” biomarkers of neurodegeneration or neuronal injury ([18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose–PET, structural MRI, or CSF total tau). Conflicting results within a category would be labeled “c.” For example, if an individual had conflicting results from amyloid PET and CSF Ab,heorshemight be labeled Ac.Individuals can be fully classified by CSF alone, imaging alone, or combinations.Several different approaches to selecting normal/ abnormal cutpoints in the continuous range of biomarker values exist. These include selecting values that best separate clinically normal individuals from those with dementia, values that have predictive power for future clinical decline,53 or using autopsied individuals with antemortem biomarker studies to guide selection of cutpoints.51,52 In laboratory medicine, the 95th percentile based on a healthy control population is commonly used or the 10th percentile of values seen in typical AD dementia.21,55. Biomarker values are then scaled linearly from 0 (normal) to 100 (abnormal). The centiloid scale is related to but not identical to percentiles because centiloid values below 0 (i.e., below the mean for the normal group) and above 100 (i.e., above the mean for the abnormal group) are possible. An example of how this might appear is A80/T50/N20.",

Imaging-to-autopsy comparison studies have established that amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) is a valid in vivo surrogate for Ab deposits (in brain parenchyma/vessel walls) [17–24].Itis also now widely accepted that CSF Ab42 (or the Ab42/ Ab40 ratio) is a valid indicator of the abnormal pathologic state associated with cerebral Ab [25]. An additional development has been the introduction of PET ligands for pathologic tau [26–28]. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, and CSF total tau (T-tau)—are not specific for AD but rather are nonspecific indicators of damage that may derive from a variety of etiologies, for example, cerebrovascular injury [29]."

AD is a\n        common cause of cognitive impairment acquired in midlife and late-life\n        but its clinical impact is modified by other neurodegenerative and\n        cerebrovascular conditions. This Primer conceives of AD biology as the\n        brain disorder that results from a complex interplay of loss of synaptic\n        homeostasis and dysfunction in the highly interrelated\n        endosomal/lysosomal clearance pathways in which the precursors,\n        aggregated species and post-translationally modified products of Aβ and\n        tau play important roles. Therapeutic endeavours are still struggling to\n        find targets within this framework that substantially change the\n        clinical course in persons with AD."

When Aβ plaques are on the surface of neuronal cell bodies, they disrupt GABAergic synapses in the perisomatic region. This loss of GABAergic inhibition is significant because it may cause neurons to become hyperactive due to a lack of inhibitory control around the cell body. Aβ plaques near the dendrites in the neuropil may lead to the loss of dendritic spines, which are small protrusions that typically form excitatory synapses. This loss of dendritic spines means a partial reduction in excitatory input to those neurons, but it doesn’t heavily impact the overall control of their activity since it only affects part of the dendritic structure. In summary, Aβ plaques can reduce inhibitory synapses (causing hyperactivity) near the cell bodies of neurons and reduce excitatory synapses on dendrites in the neuropil. Each change has a different impact on neuronal activity and synaptic circuits, contributing to the disruptions seen in Alzheimer's Disease."

It remains normal in most other neurodegenerative diseases, making it a reliable biomarker for AD pathology. T-tau: Reflects general neuronal injury rather than AD-specific tau pathology. T-tau increases in response to various neuronal injuries (e.g., traumatic brain injury), distinguishing it from P-tau, which rises specifically in AD. Tau PET and CSF P-tau cannot detect minimal neurofibrillary changes, impacting the diagnostic distinction between “Alzheimer’s pathologic change” and full AD."

The aperiodic component is additionally parameterized with an ‘offset’ parameter, which reflects the uniform shift of power across frequencies. The aperiodic offset, for example, is correlated with both neuronal population spiking13,14 and the blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal from functional MRI15. The aperiodic exponent, in contrast, has been related to the integration of the underlying synaptic currents26. Currents with faster time constants, such as excitatory (E) AMPA, have relatively constant power at lower frequencies before power quickly decays, whereas for inhibitory (I) GABA currents power decays more slowly as a function of frequency. This means that the exponent will be lower (flatter PSD) when E » I, and larger when E« I."

Various methods designed to avoid this issue have been introduced but are limited to particular assumptions about its temporal characteristics. Here, we investigate the usefulness of a model-based geometric correction scheme (GCS) to suppress spatial leakage emanating from the seed location. We analyze its properties theoretically and then assess potential advantages and limitations with simulated and experimental MEG data (resting state and auditory-motor task). To do so, we apply Minimum Norm Estimation (MNE) for source reconstruction and use variation of error parameters, statistical gauging of spatial leakage correction and comparison with signal orthogonalization. Results show that the GCS has a local (i.e., near the seed) effect only, in line with the geometry of MNE spatial leakage, and is able to map spatially all types of brain interactions, including linear correlations eliminated after signal orthogonalization. Furthermore, it is robust against the introduction of forward model errors. On the other hand, the GCS can be affected by local overcorrection effects and seed mislocation. These issues arise with signal orthogonalization too, although significantly less extensively, so the two approaches complement each other. The GCS thus appears to be a valuable addition to the spatial leakage correction toolkits for seed-based FC analyses in source-projected MEG/EEG data"
