The aperiodic component is additionally parameterized with an \u2018offset\u2019 parameter, which reflects the uniform shift of power across frequencies. The aperiodic offset, for example, is correlated with both neuronal population spiking13,14 and the blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal from functional MRI15. The aperiodic exponent, in contrast, has been related to the integration of the underlying synaptic currents26. Currents with faster time constants, such as excitatory (E) AMPA, have relatively constant power at lower frequencies before power quickly decays, whereas for inhibitory (I) GABA currents power decays more slowly as a function of frequency. This means that the exponent will be lower (flatter PSD) when E \u00BB I, and larger when E\u00AB I." }), "Aperiodic components can be extracted thanks to FOOOF algorithm of the same authors.", _jsx(CitationCard, { citations: [ParamsPSD], children: "The observation of within-subject changes of the aperiodic exponent also has implications regarding the ubiquitous negative correlation between low-frequency (<30 Hz) and high-frequency (>40 Hz) activity38, observed here in the EEG data (Fig. 5d). This is often interpreted as a push/pull relationship between low-frequency oscillations and gamma; however spectral parameterization offers a different interpretation: a see-saw-like rotation of the spectrum at around 20\u201330 Hz due to a change in aperiodic activity." }), _jsx(CitationCard, { citations: [NeuroChemsOrganizationAd], children: "In patients with aMCI and AD, both aperiodic offsets and slopes are altered, particularly in prefrontal and parieto-occipital regions.
