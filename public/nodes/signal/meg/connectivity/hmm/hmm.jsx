      Hidden Markov Models (HMM) have been used to model the progression of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). This model is based on the assumption that the
      progression of AD can be divided into a finite number of states, each
      representing a different stage of the disease. The transition between
      states is governed by a set of probabilities, which can be estimated from
      longitudinal data. HMMs have been shown to be effective in capturing the
      complex dynamics of AD progression and have been used to predict the
      future course of the disease in individual patients.This approach, which
      identifies the points in time at which unique patterns of
      electrophysiological activity recur, revealed transient (100â€“200 ms) brain
      states with spatial topographies similar to RSNs
