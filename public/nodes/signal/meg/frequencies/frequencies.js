The results showed that early A\u03B2 deposition is with macroscopic neurophysiological manifestations of hyperactivity, expressed as an acceleration of neurophysiological oscillatory activity reflected by increased alpha-band and decreased delta-band activity. As predicted from disease models, we also found that these effects shift from oscillatory acceleration to slowing in individuals presenting early temporal lobe tau pathology and that the magnitude of the shift from neurophysiological acceleration to slowing is associated with longitudinal cognitive decline.
