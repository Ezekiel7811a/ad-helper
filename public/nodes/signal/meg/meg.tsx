        Recently, a range of novel features derived from electroencephalography
        (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings have been described as
        robust proxy makers for noninvasive real-time measurements of changes in
        E/I balance.

      Nakamura et al. (2017): This MEG study found altered network organization
      in healthy elderly individuals with high amyloid levels, particularly in
      the inferior parietal lobe and precuneus. The correlation between Aβ and
      brain synchrony indicates that network impairment precedes metabolic
      (FDG-PET) or structural (MRI) changes, suggesting that M/EEG could detect
      functional changes before visible atrophy.
